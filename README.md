# The Underhanded Cairo Contest

The goal of The Underhanded Cairo Contest, inspired by [The Underhanded Solidity Contest](https://underhanded.soliditylang.org/), is to write seemingly harmless Cairo code which actually contains mailicious behaviour and/or backdoors.

## Brief

The scope of possible submissions is not limited to any theme, it could be a simple ERC20, an AMM or an NFT drop contract. That being said, the name of the game is simplicity. You'll need to provide an explanation about the flaw in your submission, to be put in a separate file called `exploit.txt` or `spoiler.txt`. This is so the judges can assess how difficult it is to find the flaw without seeing the explainer first!

## Submissions & Deadline

The contest will run from 2022-04-02 untill 2022-04-24, the winners will be announced on the last day of the StarkNet Hackathon at Devconnect Amsterdam.

Please email your submissions before the deadline to underhanded@nethermind.io. Your submission should consist of a ZIP file containing a README describing your submission and how it works, please remember to put any spoilers in a separate file! Please do not include identifying information in the ZIP file.
